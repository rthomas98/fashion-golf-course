            <h3>Welcome to our <small>“All Year Round” Golf Course</small></h3>
            
            <p>From first sight of the course, it elicits anticipation and hopefulness in players of all skill levels. Fashion tests one’s perceptual ability, judgment, decision-making, shot making, and emotional poise and is interesting and engaging without being overly demanding. The beautiful Fashion Golf course design makes full use of the topography and play twists, turns and flows over a variety of interesting landforms with each hole offering its own visual identity.</p>
            
            <p>Some holes offer respite and opportunities for birdies, but overall Fashion will provide an enthralling examination of the full range of golfing skills.</p>

                <h3>Course Details</h3>
                <p>In the summer, the course plays firm and fast, with lightning fast greens that frequently give a stimpmeter reading of over 9. In winter, or very wet conditions, the course is free draining; meaning that we rarely, if ever, close and winter tees and greens are seldom needed.</p>
                
                <p>Water hazards are a feature on many holes and the greens, though large, play smaller than their size, as many of them are raised slightly from the surrounding terrain.</p>
